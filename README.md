# Flappy-bird
In this project I have a developed a  very popular  game called Flappy  Bird .I have used pure HTML, CSS and javascript.
With the help of html i have created pillars which will be used as an obstacles for the bird that will be flying. 
With the help of CSS I have designed the pillars in an attractive way.
Now notice one thing that I have designed the pillars with the random length because if all the pillars would be in same size then there would be no fun in playing the game.
In the javascript part we will be making the bird fly by using the parallax effects on it and a sprite sheet of the movements of the bird will also be used because when the bird would be flying it would be flying in different positions so as a result we have to make the sprite sheet in dynamic form.
Now using the math.random() function in the project we can design pillars with random sizes  so we can make the game much more interesting.
Suppose when the bird hits any of the pillars then the game would be over and to detect it I have used Collide property  to detect the collision and end the game 
Using the increment operator we will be incrementing the score  and if the bird passes one pillar then it will get one point and  when the bird hits the pillar a bang image will also be displayed
